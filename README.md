# 🎥 Ray Tracing Engine 🧠✨🖥️

A Ray Tracing project developed as part of an academic software engineering course,
focusing on computer graphics, 3D geometry, and realistic image rendering 🎓🎨

This project implements a simplified yet powerful ray tracing engine, demonstrating
core concepts such as ray–object intersection, lighting models, shadows, and image generation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌟 Project Overview

Ray Tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light
to produce highly realistic images.

This project focuses on:
- Mathematical modeling of 3D scenes
- Accurate light simulation
- Clean and modular software design
- Clear separation between rendering logic, scene description, and output generation

The engine casts rays from a virtual camera through each pixel,
calculates intersections with objects in the scene,
and determines the final color based on lighting and geometry.

## 🎯 Features & Capabilities

- Ray–Object intersection calculations  
- Basic lighting model (ambient / diffuse / specular)  
- Shadow computation  
- Image generation and export  
- Support for multiple geometric primitives  
- Clear separation between math, rendering, and scene logic  
- Unit tests for core components  

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

Ray Tracing Pipeline:
- Ray generation from camera
- Intersection detection
- Lighting calculation
- Color composition per pixel

Mathematical Foundations:
- Vector algebra
- 3D coordinate systems
- Surface normals and reflection vectors

Software Design Principles:
- Modular architecture
- High readability and maintainability
- Easy extensibility for future features (textures, reflections, refraction)
